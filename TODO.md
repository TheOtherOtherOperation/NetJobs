# NetJobs Planned Features and To-Do List

- Update minhosts behavior.
    - Better clarification between host timeout and task timeout.
- Add periodic updates to control center display, showing elapsed time and number of pending tasks for which we're still waiting and number of hosts we've lost. E.g. (1:15:30) Pending jobs: 2 of 4. Hosts lost: 0 of 2.
- Better abstraction of packet-receipt process in control center. Parts of packet-receipt logic are currently implemented in different locations.
